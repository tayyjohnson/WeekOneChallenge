Horiseon Accessibility
So in this final finalized version of my code I ended up mainly just reorganizing mostly everything between CSS & the index. 
In the index I deleted a few classes that were seemed either excessive or repetitive especially when there was already a ton of "blanket" classes that could be used.
When looking at the CSS I modified that a lot to make it way more condensed & essentially just added onto the pre-existing elements/classes.
The other thing I noticed was the link for search engine optomization wasn't working since it didnt have the "id=" tag in front of it, so that got fixed.
I also added in for just about every single image on this page some sort of description for them by using "alt=" so people with disabilities could still underdstand what was on the page.
